## TL;DR

- The Starknet Foundation, in collaboration with StarkWare, is launching Devonomics, an experimental pilot program that puts Starknet developers first by rewarding and empowering them.
- Devonomics is initially allocating over 1600 ETH ($3.5M+ at time of publication), constituting 10% of all transaction fees accumulated until November 30, 2023.
- The program runs through a transparent and inclusive distribution process, unique to Ethereumâ€™s L2 landscape.
- The end goal of Devonomics is to bolster developer participation in decision-making and the future operation of Starknet.

## Don't trust, verify

Wanna verify the distribution of the Devonomics funds? Take a look at `allocations.csv` in `src/csv` and find your address. The csv file contains almost 10K contracts, ordered by their allocation amount. If your address doesn't appear there, it means that it received less than ~0.000135 ETH in this round.
