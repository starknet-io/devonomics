## TL;DR

- The Starknet Foundation, in collaboration with StarkWare, is launching Devonomics, an experimental pilot program that puts Starknet developers first by rewarding and empowering them.
- Devonomics is initially allocating over 1600 ETH ($3.5M+ at time of publication), constituting 10% of all transaction fees accumulated until November 30, 2023.
- The program runs through a transparent and inclusive distribution process, unique to Ethereumâ€™s L2 landscape.
- The end goal of Devonomics is to bolster developer participation in decision-making and the future operation of Starknet.
